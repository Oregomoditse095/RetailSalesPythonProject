# Sales Data Management Program

## Overview

This Python program is designed to help small retail stores manage their sales data for different products over a span of a month. It utilizes 1D and 2D arrays to store and analyze sales information, providing various functionalities for data entry, analysis, and reporting.

## Features

### a) Product Names

- The program starts by prompting the user to input the names of 5 products sold in the store. These names are stored in a list.

### b) Sales Data Entry

- After entering product names, the user is prompted to input the sales quantity for each product-week combination (4 weeks and 5 products).
- The sales data is stored in a 2D array.

### c) Total Sales per Product

- The program calculates and displays the total sales quantity for each product over the 4-week period using the sales data array.

### d) Total Sales per Week

- It calculates and displays the total sales quantity for the store each week.

### e) Best Selling Product

- Identifies and displays the product that had the highest sales quantity during the month, along with the quantity sold.

### f) Weekly Performance

- Calculates and displays the average sales quantity per week for the store.

### g) Product Performance

- Calculates and displays the average sales quantity per product for the month.

### h) Sales Growth Analysis

- Compares the sales quantity between consecutive weeks and identifies which week had the highest increase in sales.

### i) Lowest Sales Product

- Determines the product with the lowest sales quantity for the month and displays its name and quantity.

### j) Sales Forecasting

- Allows the user to input a prediction for the sales quantity of each product for the next week and displays the predicted sales quantities.

### k) Sales Report

- Generates a simple sales report summarizing the total sales, best/worst products, and other key statistics.
